            <p>Hello, and welcome to my online portfolio. Please, take your time looking around :)</p>

            <h2>Android App</h2>
            <p>Below is a demo of an android app that I made as part of a group project during first year. I was in charge of UX design, <br>
            writing the report, and editing the demo as shown below.</p>

            <h2>Game Jam 1</h2>
            <p>Here's a game I made for Blackthornprod's Game Jam. It's the first game I ever made, <br>
            so the controls are janky, but I'm proud of it. Especially since I made all the art and music too :)</p>

            <img src = "resources/game2.png">
            <img src = "resources/game3.png">
            <img src = "resources/game4.png">
            <p>Background music (made in Bosca Ceoil): </p>
            <audio controls>
                <source src="resources/better.wav" type="audio/wav">

            </audio>
            <p>The game jam lasted a week and the theme was 'Less is More'. Using Unity, I built a really simple platformer <br>
            where the player controls a little ball guy. As he progresses, the camera pans out to reveal more of the level. The idea <br>
            is that, even if you think you're not making much progress, it adds up over time - so, 'Less is More' :)</p>
            <p>You can download and play the game here: <a href = "https://min-elizabeth.itch.io/heart" target="blank">Less is More</a></p>

            <h2>Game Jam 2</h2>
            <p>Here's a game I made for Brackey's Game Jam. It's my second game and also made in Unity. <br>
            Similarly, I drew all the art and composed the music. Had to use Google a lot for the code though, haha...</p>

            <img src = "resources/fire3.png">
            <p>Background music (made in Bosca Ceoil): </p>
            <audio controls>
                <source src="resources/tinkly winkly.wav" type="audio/wav">

            <p>This game jam also lasted a week and the theme was 'Stronger Together'. I came up with the idea that fire grows stronger <br>
            when there's more of it, so the player is a little fire dude. He's snowed in, and he has to rescue the other fires to become <br>
            stronger and melt the snow outside. It's a simple escape room style game where you solve puzzles to progress.</p>

            <h2>Pongdemic</h2>
            <img src = "resources/pong1.png">
            <p>Myself and two others made Pongdemic during a 24 hour hackathon run by the university. It's the basic game of pong... <br>
            ... but coronavirus pandemic themed. I sourced most of the images and coded the things like the menu. My other teammate coded <br>
            the pong mechanics and another found the coughing sound effects.</p>

            <p>Yeah, this one was fun :)</p>

            <h2>Sadie is Angry</h2>
            <p>I made Sadie is Angry with one other friend. It's a simple platformer about Sadie, a teenager who is angry about the current <br>
            system of education. She runs and stomps through classrooms. With each stomp, she activates different platforms that can help her <br>
            acquire 'calmness' coins. Hopefully she is less angry by the end.</p>

            <img src = "resources/sadie2.png">
            <img src = "resources/sadie3.png">
            <p>This one is still in development~</p>

            <p>And those are all the significant projects I've worked/ been working on! When I think about it, they were all done this year (2021).
                <br> Thanks for reading :)
